# String Calculator - Test Driven Development (TDD)

This project implements a string calculator based on the **TDD** (Test-Driven Development) approach. The calculator is designed to handle basic addition of numbers provided as strings, while supporting custom delimiters and validating specific constraints.

## Features
- Add numbers separated by commas or newlines.
- Handle custom delimiters, including multi-character delimiters.
- Throw an error for negative numbers.
- Ignore numbers greater than 1000.
- Return sum for n numbers (limited to 100 for demo purposes).

## Testing Strategy

The application follows the **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** approach where we start by writing tests, and then implement the logic to make those tests pass.
